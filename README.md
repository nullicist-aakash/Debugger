# Debugger

I am referring to this [Book](https://nostarch.com/building-a-debugger). With the help of this project, I intend to learn about OS <-> Process interaction and Linux ABI, and gain a working knowledge of the same.

The expected time to complete the debugger is before the end of Dceember 2025.

The final goal is to land a job in low latency development role, where I specialize in performance optimizations of trading systems.
