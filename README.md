# Debugger

I am referring to this [Book](https://nostarch.com/building-a-debugger). With the help of this project, I intend to learn about OS <-> Process interaction and Linux ABI, and gain a working knowledge of the same.

The expected time to complete the debugger is before the end of Dceember 2025.

Post this project, I will deep dive into trading system development ([Book](https://www.amazon.in/Building-Low-Latency-Applications-ecosystem/dp/1837639353)), along with the [Computer, Enhance!](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/table-of-contents) course.

The final goal is to land a job in low latency development role, where I specialize in performance optimizations of trading systems.
