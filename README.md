# Debugger

I am referring to this [Book](https://nostarch.com/building-a-debugger). With the help of this project, I intend to learn about OS <-> Process interaction and Linux ABI, and gain a working knowledge of the same.

After this project, I will take [Computer, Enhance!](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/table-of-contents) course by Casey Muratori, and get specific knowledge about performance optimizations.

The final goal is to land a job in low latency development role, where I specialize in performance optimizations of trading systems.
